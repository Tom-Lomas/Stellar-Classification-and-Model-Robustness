# Stellar-Classification-and-Model-Robustness

This project was completed as a final project for a data science class. It includes a Jupyter notebook of the project, the dataset as a csv file, and the technical report that was completed for the project. 

For this project, there were three main questions I wanted to look at. The first question was whether or not the dataset follows the Stefan-Boltzmann law. That is, is there a positive correlation between luminosity and radius, as well as luminosity and temperature in the dataset. The second question was looking at how little characteristics of a star can be given to a model, specifically a decision tree classifier, before it's accuracy declines significantly. The third question I was looking into is the robustness of regression models, specifically a random forest regressor,  on an astronomical dataset. If high accuracy is obtained throughout various tests of the model, then regression models such as random forest regressors could be used to predict absolute magnitude in large scale datasets where information may be missing.

In the future I would like to find a real dataset with more rows to better test these models as well as using more advanced models.
